                    <p class="card">I am an aspiring web designer that loves everything about the web. I've lived in Nevada almost my whole life and am a member of the Army National Guard stationed out in Stead. I've been a flight engineer for most of my career and am eager to to change my path to a more digital one.
                    This is my firt website and I am continuously working on it every time I learn something new. So far, the site is built using HTML and CSS. I am not completley finished with the product but am always adding to it in my free time.

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p class="card">I want to increase my knowledge of backend software engineering by learnig front-end development. I am focusing on my website to try to showcase my desire to in development. After this, JavaScript and JQuery. Then, SQL database manipulation to get a better understanding of what I learned in school. My hope is that on day, all of this will connect with my C++,
                    Python and Java experience.
